# ghui

Terminal UI for keeping up with your open GitHub pull requests across repositories.

`ghui` gives you one keyboard-driven place to review PR details, inspect diffs, leave diff comments, manage labels, toggle draft state, merge, open PRs in GitHub, and copy PR metadata without leaving the terminal.
